# Fun-games
Python is a versatile programming language that has been used to create many fun games, including Mad Libs and Guess a Number.
## Mad Libs
Is a word game where players are asked to provide words to fill in the blanks of a story, resulting in a funny and often nonsensical tale. 
## Guess a Number 
Is a simple number-guessing game where the computer randomly generates a number and the player tries to guess it. Both games are a great way to learn the basics of programming in Python and have fun at the same time.

## Bank App
The bank application implements basic operations like deposit, withdrawal, and check balance, ask for a password with a limit to the number of times you can enter a password, and allows the user to perform multiple transactions.
